# QLA-Simulation
This project simulates an adaptive educational system using a Q-learning algorithm. The simulation is designed to manage and adapt the difficulty of educational content based on the learner's performance, optimizing learning outcomes through smart question assignment.

# Description
The simulation models a simple educational environment where a student interacts with a learning system that offers questions of varying difficulties. The environment is modeled with a finite state machine consisting of four states and actions corresponding to different question difficulties. The Q-learning algorithm helps the system learn the optimal strategy to maximize the student's learning potential by dynamically adjusting the difficulty of the questions.
